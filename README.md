## Local development 

Either setup a local database or use the `respiroproduction` database, see
`application-dev.properties` file. This will let you get 
the app up immediately without having to setup a database yourself. 

Run the [learningApp.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Flearningapp%2FlearningApp.java).




## Deployment

The database and application is running on the same server. See 
`/server` folder.
